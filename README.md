# Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation Model

## Overview
This repository houses the code for a model designed to accurately recognize food items from images and estimate their calorie content. The primary objective is to empower users to track their dietary intake and make informed food choices. Leveraging deep learning techniques, the model combines food item recognition with calorie estimation for a comprehensive dietary tracking solution.

## Kaggle Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from Kaggle and is known as the Food-101 dataset. This comprehensive dataset comprises a diverse collection of food images with corresponding labels, facilitating the development of a robust food recognition and calorie estimation model. Access the dataset  (https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/food-101).

## Model Used
The model employed for this project is based on deep learning principles, particularly utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs are well-suited for image classification tasks, making them an ideal choice for recognizing various food items. The architecture also incorporates components to estimate the calorie content of the identified food items, providing users with comprehensive dietary information.
